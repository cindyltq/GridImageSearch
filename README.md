Grid Image Search
==================

This is the second assignment app of Android Boot Camp. This app uses Google Image Search API to search for images based on users' settings on images attributes including color, size, type, and the site search within. The returned image results are displayed on an endless scolling grid. By clicking each image icon, users can view an enlarged image and can change the scale of the image, and can share the image via email.
